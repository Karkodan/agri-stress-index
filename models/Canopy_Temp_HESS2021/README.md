CONTENT

LuanVico_HESS_2021_canopy_temp_model.zip contains the MatLab codes to solve the canopy heat, carbon and water balance, and determine the daily maximum canopy temperature, as a function of plant and pedoclimatic parameters.

The codes were developed in MatLab R2018a.


MODEL RUNNING

Run main_plantsolver_LuanVicoHESS.m 

The key model parameters are listed in PARAMETERS.m. The model run parameters ale listed at the beginning of main_plantsolver_LuanVicoHESS.m

This will call all the necessary functions. 

The run returns the time series of the key model outputs, including
s soil moisture (unitless)
Tl canopy temperature (deg C)
Anleaf leaf-level photosynthetic rate (mu mol/m^2/s)
ciopt CO2 concetration at the photosynthetic site, under optimal stomatal conductance (mol/mol)
Lambda_ws marginal water use efficiency (mol/mol)
Vcmax maximum carboxylation rate, considering canopy temperature and water status (mu mol/m^2leaf/s)
ETcanopy evapotranspiration rate (per unit ground area) (mol/s/m2ground)
gal, gbl,gh, gha, gp, gs, gbl gscopt, gsrp, gv conductances (mol/m^2/s)
psil psir psis water potentials of leaf, root and soil respectively (MPa)
VPD canopy water pressure decificit (mol/mol)
rainsubd daily precipitation (mm)
T_airsubd daily maximum air temperature (deg C)
Rabs absorbed radiation (W/m^2)
Q_Short and Q_Long incomning short and longwave radiation (W/m^2)

Some of these model outputs are plotted in the figures generated by the function.
